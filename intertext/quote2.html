<div class="back"><a href="yourparis.html">Back</a></div>

<div class="ted"> Your practiced lips Translated the spasms to what you excused As your gushy burblings which I decoded Into a language, utterly new to me With conjectural, hopelessly wrong meanings You gave me no hint how, at every corner, My fingers linked in yours, you expected The final fate-to-face revelation To grab your whole body.</div>

Above the revolving, rumbling city: stay clear.</div>
