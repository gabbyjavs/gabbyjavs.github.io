<div class="ted"> What searching miles 
Did you drag your pain That were for me plain paving, albeit Pecked by the odd, stray, historic bullet. The mere dog in me, happy to protect you 
From your agitation and your stone hours, Like a guide dog, loyal to correct your stumblings, Yawned and dozed and watched you calm yourself With your anaesthetic. Your drawing, as by touch, Roofs, a traffic bollard, a bottle, me.
