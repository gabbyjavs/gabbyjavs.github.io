<div class="excerpt3"> 
When you stepped, in a shatter of exclamations, Out of the Hotel des Deux Continents Through frame after frame, Street after street, of Impressionist paintings, Under the chestnut shades of Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Henry Miller, Gertrude Stein. <div class="a1"> <a href="quote1.html"> I wanted to humour you.</a></div> I kept my Paris from you.
<br>
<br>
Your practiced lips Translated <div class="a2"> <a href="quote2.html"> the spasms to what you excused As your gushy burblings</a></div> which I decoded Into a language, utterly new to me With conjectural, hopelessly wrong meanings You gave me no hint how, at every corner, My fingers linked in yours, you expected The final fate-to-face revelation To grab your whole body.
<br>
<br>
What searching miles 
Did you drag your pain That were for me plain paving, albeit Pecked by the odd, stray, historic bullet. The mere dog in me, happy to protect you 
From your agitation and your stone hours, Like a guide dog, <div class="a3"><a href="quote3.html"> loyal to correct your stumblings, Yawned and dozed and watched you calm yourself With your anaesthetic.</a></div> Your drawing, as by touch, Roofs, a traffic bollard, a bottle, me.
</div>

<div class="hate">Your worship needed a god. Where it lacked one, it found one in me.</div>
