<div class="Sylvia"><a href="http://www.sylviaplath.de/" target="blank"> Sylvia Plath</a></div>

<div class="SylviaStory">Born to middle class parents in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, Sylvia Plath published her first poem <br> when she was eight. Sensitive, intelligent, compelled toward perfection in everything she attempted, <br> she was, on the surface, a model daughter, popular in school, earning straight A's, winning the best <br> prizes. By the time she entered Smith College on a scholarship in 1950 she already had an impressive <br> list of publications, and while at Smith she wrote over four hundred poems. <br>
<br>

In 1956 she married the English poet Ted Hughes , and in 1960, when she was 28, her first book, The <br> Colossus, was published in England. The poems in this book---formally precise, well wrought---show <br> clearly the dedication with which Sylvia had served her apprenticeship; yet they give only glimpses of <br> what was to come in the poems she would begin writing early in 1961. She and Ted Hughes settled for <br> a while in an English country village in Devon, but less than two years after the birth of their first child <br> the marriage broke apart. <br> <br>

On February 11, 1963, Sylvia Plath killed herself with cooking gas at the age of 30. Two years later Ariel, <br> a collection of some of her last poems, was published; this was followed by Crossing the Water and <br> Winter Trees in 1971, and, in 1981, The Collected Poems appeared, edited by Ted Hughes.</div>

<div class="TedStory">The rural landscape of Hughes’s youth in Yorkshire exerted a lasting influence on his work. To read <br> Hughes’s poetry is to enter a world dominated by nature, especially by animals. This holds true for <br> nearly all of his books, from The Hawk in the Rain to Wolfwatching (1989) and Moortown Diary (1989), <br> two of his late collections. Hughes’s love of animals was one of the catalysts in his decision to become <br> a poet. According to London Times contributor Thomas Nye, Hughes once confessed that he began <br> writing poems in adolescence, when it dawned upon him that his earlier passion for hunting animals <br> in his native Yorkshire ended either in the possession of a dead animal, or at best a trapped one. <br> <br>

Though Hughes is now unequivocally recognized as one of the greatest poets of the 20th century, his <br> reputation as a poet during his lifetime was perhaps unfairly framed by two events: the suicide of Plath <br> in 1963, and, in 1969, the suicide of the woman he left Plath for, Assia Wevill, who also took the life of <br> their young daughter, Shura. As Plath’s executor, Hughes’s decision to destroy her final diary and his <br> refusal of publication rights to her poems irked many in the literary community. Hughes’s unpopular <br> decisions regarding Plath’s writings, over which he had total control after her death, were often in <br> service of his definition of privacy.It was with great surprise that, in 1998, the literary world received <br> Hughes’s quite intimate portrait of Plath in the form of Birthday Letters, a collection of prose poems <br> covering every aspect of his relationship with his first wife.</div>

<div class="RelationshipStory">After an acclaimed start as a poet and while an undergraduate at Smith College, Plath attempted suicide. <br> At age 20, she took 48 sleeping pills during a stint guest-editing Mademoiselle. She was hospitalized, <br> recovered, and went on a Fulbright Scholarship to Cambridge. There, in 1956, she met Ted Hughes, also a <br> "promising" poet. Four months after their first encounter, in which Plath bit a chunk out of Hughes' cheek, <br> they married. Each pursued careers as poets, and she bore two children. In October 1962, Hughes moved <br> out of their house to pursue an affair with Assia Gutmann Wevill, a family friend. Four months later, Plath <br> killed herself. After her death, Hughes retained all rights to her work and withheld them form the public.</div>
